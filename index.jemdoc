== About me
I'm a first-year CS graduate student at [http://www.ucla.edu/ UCLA]. My current research interest focuses on *multimodal machine learning* and *healthcare/bio-medicine*. As the nature of human communication is *multimodal*, I aspire to get computers to reach new heights in their understanding and open up new avenues for AI in healthcare. \n

#My research interest lies widely in the scope of Multimodal Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Audio Signal Processing, and Healthcare/Bio-medicine.  

I have been pondering how machines can break out of their computational boundaries to understand human intelligence. My goal is to develop computationally efficient machine learning as well as deep learning models and algorithms, building the computational foundations to enable computers with the abilities to analyze, recognize and predict subtle human communicative behaviors during social interactions. Applications include computer vision, natural language processing, audio signal processing, and drug discovery.

I love *open-source* community and making contributions to the open-source world, like [https://github.com/Eurus-Holmes GitHub]. In [https://gitstar-ranking.com/ Gitstar Ranking], I rank [https://gitstar-ranking.com/Eurus-Holmes Top 0.03%] of all GitHub developers (more than 37,000,000) by GitHub stars. [https://github-profile-trophy.vercel.app/?username=Eurus-Holmes&column=7&theme=dracula&rank=SECRET,SSS,SS,S Here] is my [https://github.com/ryo-ma/github-profile-trophy Github Profile Trophy], I'd like to discover, share, and build better software for this world. I am the core member of some open-source organizations, such as [https://github.com/TheAlgorithms The Algorithms], [https://github.com/apachecn ApacheCN], and [https://github.com/doocs Doocs]. I am also a student member at [https://www.ieee.org/ IEEE] and [https://www.acm.org/ ACM].

My favorite quote: \n 
*/"The thing that’s worth doing is trying to improve our understanding of the world and gain a better appreciation of the universe and not to worry too much about there being no meaning."/*
